# Extended Globbing

See http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-extended-globbing

To enable extended glob, `shopt -s extglob` or exec bash with `-O extglob`.

```
?(pattern-list)   Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
*(pattern-list)   Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
+(pattern-list)   Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
@(pattern-list)   Matches one of the given patterns
!(pattern-list)   Matches anything except one of the given patterns
```

`dir/!(*.gz)` matches everything but .gz files _in the dir directory_.

## Pitfalls

Don't do `*!(.jpg|gif)`, do `!(*.jpg|*.gif)`.

# Get dirname

`$(cd "$(dirname "$BASH_SOURCE")"; pwd)`
